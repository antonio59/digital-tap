              <p>
                This campaign began at Poplar DLR station. I was already running late and both of the tap points were out of 
                order again. The only option was going to the other platform to try the other touch points there. The train I 
                needed pulled in. I was on the wrong platform, rushing to get back. The doors closed. The train left. Not because 
                I was late, but because the system couldn't keep up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whilst we're fortunate to have frequent DLR services, I have to catch a connecting train at Tower Hill, and DLR 
                services to Tower Gateway aren't as frequent as those to Bank, so timing matters. Missing one train doesn't just 
                mean waiting a few minutes; it means missing my connection and adding 15-30 minutes to my journey depending on 
                the time of day.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when I realised this wasn't just my problem. It affects thousands of passengers daily. Many stations or 
                platforms only have a single touchpoint per platform, or two maximum. If one of those is out of service, or 
                during rush hour, you're queuing for what feels like forever. And if there are users arriving and departing at 
                the same time, it becomes a juggle as you try to let those trying to catch the next train tap in before you: an 
                awkward dance of "no, you go first" whilst you wait to leave the station.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold text-gray-700">
                But the frustrations don't end there.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was at Heron Quays DLR the other day. I get that some stations don't have barriers. But at this station, 
                the validators aren't anywhere near where you'd see them in your eye line, or close to the stairs. I travel a 
                lot around London and was completely baffled by this station. It's as if they've intentionally hidden the tap 
                points so people don't pay. How many passengers miss them entirely? How much revenue is Transport for London 
                losing simply because of poor placement?
              </p>
              <p>
                Then there's the uncertainty. Did my tap register? The readers often lag, giving no immediate feedback. You 
                tap, wait, see nothing, tap again, and suddenly you've double-charged yourself or, worse, invalidated your 
                journey. There's no reassurance, no confirmation sound that works consistently, no clear display. You're left 
                hoping for the best and dreading the penalty fare.
              </p>
              <p>
                The broken infrastructure is relentless. One week it's Poplar. The next it's Westferry. Then Pontoon Dock. 
                The validators rotate through a cycle of dysfunction like some kind of perverse rota. You start planning your 
                route not around which train is fastest, but around which stations might actually let you tap in today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of just complaining like everyone else, I decided to do something about it. As a web developer, I 
                knew the technology to solve this problem already exists. Airports use automatic check-in, museums use proximity 
                detection, and retail stores use beacon technology. Why not public transport?
              </p>
              <p>
                So I built this prototype in my spare time to demonstrate what's possible. What started as a weekend project 
                has grown into a movement with so many supporters who share the same frustrations and believe in a better future 
                for DLR travel.

                  <p>
                    Hi, I'm Antonio Smith, a project manager and web developer based in East London who has been commuting on 
                    the DLR for several years. My daily journey takes me through some of the busiest stations on the network (Poplar, 
                    Canary Wharf, Tower Gateway) and I've experienced firsthand the challenges of the current tap system, from broken 
                    validators to platform-hopping queues that make me miss crucial connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As someone who works with technology every day, I'm passionate about using it to solve real-world problems. 
                    When I saw how existing technologies like Bluetooth beacons and automatic detection could transform the DLR 
                    experience, I knew I had to build a demonstration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't about replacing TfL's infrastructure. It's about enhancing it. Physical tap points would remain 
                    fully operational for everyone, whilst giving passengers who choose to opt in a faster, contactless alternative 
                    using their phones.

                  Digital tap would be an additional option, not a replacement. This ensures everyone can travel comfortably, 
                  whether they prefer digital or physical tapping.

                  Physical tap points would continue to work exactly as they do now. Digital tap is about adding convenience 
                  for those who want it, not removing options from those who don't. Everyone should be able to travel in the 
                  way that works best for them.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  While we don't have official cost estimates, similar beacon-based systems in other contexts (airports, retail) 
                  have proven relatively affordable. The infrastructure already exists. It's about adding beacons and software. 
                  Any implementation would need TfL's full feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis.

                  We engage with TfL continuously through monthly social media posts and ongoing advocacy. Rather than waiting 
                  for a fixed target, we're building sustained momentum and compiling data packages as support grows. When we have 
                  substantial backing and compelling evidence, we'll pursue formal meetings with TfL leadership and present our case 
                  for a pilot programme.
